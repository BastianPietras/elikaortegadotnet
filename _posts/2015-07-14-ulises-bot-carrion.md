A few weeks ago I published/launched
[@BotCarrion](https://twitter.com/BotCarrion), a Twitter bot that
reimagines Ulises Carrión's *The New Art of Making Books* from 1975.
@BotCarrion is the product of the Advanced E-Lit Criticism and Authoring
course at DHSI 2015. Aside from Sandy Baldwin and Dene Grigar, I have
much to thank Aaron Reed for the tutorial he led on the really awesome
tools with which I built the bot:
[Tracery](http://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) a tool for writing
generative grammars developed by Kate Compton, and [Cheap Bots Done
Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) by George Buckenham. (This tool
combo is also the basis of fascinating bots like
[@unicode\_garden](https://twitter.com/unicode_garden) and
[@infinitedeserts](https://twitter.com/infinitedeserts)among many
others).

\[If you know nothing about Ulises Carrión. These are two good overviews
in English: Mónica de la Torre’s [Ulises Carrión’s The Poet’s
Tongue](http://bombmagazine.org/article/6931/ulises-carri-n-s-the-poet-s-tongue)
and Donna Conwell’s [Personal Worlds or Cultural
Strategies](http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/notes/essay/e003_text.html)\].

I have been working with Carrión’s ideas for a few years now. I’ve been
especially interested in his work dealing with post-literatures—or as I
usually explain this to my students: literature that “ceases” to be
literature (in a conventional sense of text) due to the expressive
(iconic or symbolic) material conditions that embody it, but is still
literature. His ideas on the book ring very closely (in my head at
least) with contemporary conversations on literature and software,
literature as data, literature as media, and meaning making beyond
language (visual, sound). Unsurprisingly, his work was largely deemed
antiliterary and only been rediscovered recently when Tumbona Ediciones
put out a fantastic[three volume collection of his writings in
Spanish](http://www.tumbonaediciones.com/tumbona/titulos/anomalos-col/el-arte-correo-y-el-gran-monstruo#).
Worth noting is that some of them had never been translated from their
original in English, which Carrión adopted as a writing language in the
mid-seventies.

I had been toying with the idea of building an Ulises Carrión bot for a
while. I especially wanted to draw on his “Structure” and “Model” poems
to do it, but the results of my experiments were always too “bot-y.”
They didn’t sound like Carrión at all and I couldn’t incorporate the
aspects of his diction that I wanted to highlight: the
half-manifesto-half-prophecy-maybe-it’s-a-joke tone a lot of his works
feature. Still, I insisted and continued to experiment with this because
I think Carrión’s work is extremely relevant in conversations dealing
with electronic literature and other digital arts, media studies, DH,
etc. However, Carrión is still largely unknown in these fields, at least
in the English speaking academia—and thus I’m hoping @BotCarrion can
make a bit of outreach work for the artist and theorist that inspired
him. This is why, even when *The New Art* was first published in
Spanish, I chose to take the English language version published almost
simultaneously as the bot’s basis.

In the month since its publication @BotCarrion has been producing really
interesting combinations of tweets that both seem to align well with
Carrión’s moving-target views in *The New Art* and others that
completely turn them upside down. In that sense, I’m pleased to say that
the bot hints at a relocation of Carrión’s creative concern of negating
and countering himself.

A few examples:

Other than good luck, the reason why this seems to be working so well at
times is the combination of elements I input into the Tracery generative
grammar: 1) cherry-picked verbatim quotes from the essay (like “the
accidental container of a text”); 2) the elements he defines in the
essay like reading, text, book, poetry, writer, etc.; 3) the “operators”
that serve as a +/- hinge: is, is not, may be, may not be; and 4) the
initial refrains “In the new art” and “In the old art.”

The random combination of this means that sometimes there are tweets
with two or three negative statements, which again play well with
Carrión’s own creative contradictions. I especially like the effect of
the refrains and how much they add to the tone of the tweets—in the same
way they do in *The New Art*. Similarly, the length and punch (even if
its nonsensical) of the tweets is not unlike that of Carrión’s *dicta*.
Similarly, playing with the +/- hinge, the variations of *to be*, are
the basis of the contradiction of Carrión’s ideas, and thus the
assertion of them as well. All that said, @BotCarrion produces a lot of
really bad tweets. But as always with Twitter bots, I can only hope the
good ones make up of the rest.
