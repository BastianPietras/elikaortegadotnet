In my last post I wrote about the [unconference session on
Multilingualism in DH that took place during
DHSI.](http://lectoresdeficcion.blogs.cultureplex.ca/2014/06/17/multilingualism-dh/)
This week Martin Grandjean published some really interesting, though as
he calls them “unhappy”, [results regarding rates of acceptance
according to language in
DH2014](http://www.martingrandjean.ch/multilinguisme-dans-la-science-dh2014/).
His findings show that even though the call for papers for DH2014 was
published in 23 languages, submissions were done in only 6 languages
other than English. Even more shocking is that acceptance rate was about
50% lower for non-English language proposals than it was for English
language ones.

The questions related to this that I launched after the unconference
session were whether exchanges among different linguistic DH communities
are taking place? And whether we are speaking distinct DH dialects
depending on audience and sources? Grandjean’s conclusions, meant to be
provocative, touch some of the issues I intuited before and I’d like to
comment on them. One of his conclusions reads:

> 5\. Ce n’est pas un problème de langue, mais de réseau de cooptation.

DH2014, as the biggest and most important international conference in
the field, carries a larger responsibility to be inclusive of
practitioners around the world; while smaller, local or linguistically
focused ones, though open to other communities, usually concentrate on
promoting the field in their language and their context. Two very
different objectives to have in a conference. Still, it would seem that
the pattern is not exclusive to DH2014. Multilingual representation in
the recent
[2EHD](http://humanidadesdigitales.net/index.php/eventos/encuentro2014)
in Mexico City, as can be seen in the chart below, is not that different
to Grandjean’s results.

when the call for papers was available in [6
languages](http://humanidadesdigitales.net/index.php/eventos/encuentro2014/convocatorias)
and GO::DH contributed to the organization, only 16% of the presentation
were done in a language other than Spanish—up from only 4% in the [first
EHD](http://humanidadesdigitales.net/index.php/primer-encuentro) \[1\].
Furthermore, only English and Portuguese were represented. This
parallelism suggests precisely that though efforts are made to attract a
stronger multilingual presence to DH conferences in widely distinct
contexts and scales, it hardly happens; at least not to the extent that
one would wish. Happily, from the 2EHD data, it also appears to be
increasing. We could then actually say that different conversations
around the global DH’s don’t cross, but do touch briefly at times.

This leads me to the second issue. For Grandjean:

> 6\. Quand on est bon, on choisit l’anglais.
>
> Si le chercheur sait ou croit savoir que sa communication est de bonne
> qualité, il pourrait souhaiter la rendre accessible au plus grand
> nombre, raison pour laquelle les papiers soumis en anglais (par des
> non-anglophones) seraient en moyenne de meilleure tenue que les
> autres. Par ailleurs, le fait d’être capable de communiquer en anglais
> est, pour un chercheur non-anglophone, un indicateur de ses
> compétences et de son “internationalisme”.

This is partly what I referred to when I talked about audiences and
sources. What I think the similarity in results suggests is that we
definitely have different conversations in distinct DH contexts, and
that language choice is dependent on that. At least from the surface it
seems like a good thing, that the field can be scalable in that way:
projects have a certain relevance in a given context and a different
kind of relevance in another. I’m going to venture and say it is pretty
safe to assume that DH2014 presentations in English by non-native
speakers have been (or will be) presented in their original language in
other local conferences.

The implication of this is that in its original language a particular
project or research has its outlets. In that sense, yes, the purpose of
taking projects to DH2014 is to internationalize them, to let others
outside of their particular local contexts know about them. Indeed, this
is proof that most of us have adopted English as the *lingua franca* in
DH, but it seems to me that it can also be suggestive of how language
specific conversations are taking place elsewhere. Ultimately, it is
indicative of the importance of local conferences to foster *certain*
conversations, and the relevance of international ones to promote
*other* ones.

This still poses another problem, is the audience attending these
“translated” presentations diverse or are they the same who have
listened to/read them in “the original”? If non-English speakers are
putting the effort to internationalize their work, it is because they
(we) care about having a diverse audience and different conversations
about their projects, much more than having the call for papers
available in tens of languages (which, though immensely valuable, should
not be an end in itself). Again, the unresolved issue is the matter of
sources, conversation exchanges, and scholarship diversity.

Great efforts put towards multilingualism in DH, like the GO::DH "I
whisper\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" pins coming to DH2014 are aimed at inviting
everybody to come and speak in their own language at international
conferences, and foster collegiality and helpfulness among colleagues.
There is, still another way of contributing to this, going and listening
to the diverse, though small, non-English presentations (there will be
someone who can whisper in English too, I'm sure) and generate exchanges
and conversations. In my opinion it will be this kind of scalability of
the field in different contexts, that will help remedy the "unhappy"
results found by Grandjean regarding acceptance rates and multilingual
representativity.
