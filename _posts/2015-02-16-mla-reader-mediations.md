The place of the reader in electronic literature has conventionally been
taken as a “writerly” one, where participation, involvement,
interaction, activation, co-creation, etc. are but some of the
activities required to *read* a work. Although this is true to a certain
extent, forms of reader interaction are (in)scripted into a writer’s
intended creative composition. Explorations into how “writers of
electronic literature design, control, cast, or otherwise shape their
readers' experience and interaction” (Leonardo Flores) [have recently
started to take
place](http://leonardoflores.net/blog/scripting-the-reader-in-electronic-literature-an-asa-roundtable/).
The documentation of readers' experience of early electronic literature
is also the focus of the large scale project
[Pathfinders](http://dtc-wsuv.org/wp/pathfinders/) directed by Dene
Grigar and Stuart Moulthrop.

Further, examining what a reader *does* with a work of electronic
literature becomes even more complex if we add into the mix the ways in
which readers engage the media devices used in e-lit works. Following
Lisa Gitelman’s notion of media, in e-lit works media will carry with it
a series of associated protocols and communication practices. An example
of the potential of e-lit works to transform our conventional
relationship to media has been suggested by Lori Emerson, as creative
strategies in digital literature counter the increasing invisibility of
interfaces. Associated media practices and protocols, even when they
might be adjacent to the composition of e-lit works, will not only shape
readers’ expectations and inform their experience of said works but
also, crucially, have an effect on the readers’ experience of the work’s
material media. Experimental uses of media in e-lit works impact our
conventional uses of media devices and often reframe them in and out of
a larger media ecology.

This session invites proposals that incorporate a comparative media
approach to explore ways in which particular works of electronic
literature mediate the physical engagement of the reader with media
materials, devices, and interfaces; how readers enact and experience (as
argued by Raley) works of e-lit through the challenges it might pose to
the protocols and communication practices associated to their medium;
and how works that have been edited in different material formats are
read and experienced distinctly.

Possible topics include but are not limited to:

-       Different editions or versions of e-lit works (storage medium)\
-       Engagement and affordances of mobile and desktop versions\
-       Print and digital versions\
-       Multi-device works\
-       Emulation\
-       Reinventions of reading in e-lit works\
-       Media specific or layered reading\
-       The conjunction of machine and human reading

250 word abstracts are welcome until 15 March 2015.\
